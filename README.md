# Datasets for the SATML 2023 challenge on training data extraction

This repository contains the raw datasets for the [Training Data Extraction Challenge](https://github.com/google-research/lm-extraction-benchmark) organized at [SaTML 2023](https://satml.org/participate-competitions).

The [main repository](https://github.com/google-research/lm-extraction-benchmark) provides the challenge data as a list of pointers into [The Pile](https://pile.eleuther.ai/).

To save participants the need for downloading and decompressing 800GB of text, you can find the raw numpy files here:

## Train

* [train_prefix.npy](datasets/train_prefix.npy) (1.4 MB)
* [train_suffix.npy](datasets/train_suffix.npy) (1.4 MB)
